# Covid-19-Tracking-App

## Motivation
 The purpose is to track and show the growing number of COVID-19 cases by country. We hope to educate the population with the dangers of the disease and how it is easily spread. We also implement the symptoms of the disease.

## Technologies
We have created a full stack app that implements the technologies of Javascript, Handlebars, CSS, Bootstrap, MySql, Ajax, COVID-19 API, Github and deployed the app on Heroku.

## Usage
While using the COVID-19 API we are able to create an app that displays the growing cases of Covid 19. We have four hot spot countries shown  . With a button that we implemented you can search any country in the world and a graph will show the growing cases. With a COVID-19 FAQS button We have listed the symptoms of the disease and how COVID-19 is spread.

## Future Development
We would like to add a few more APIs and implement a coresponding map of the countries displayed. We would like to get more detailed information and break the cases down by State or Providence. we would like to use a more enhanced color scheme.
